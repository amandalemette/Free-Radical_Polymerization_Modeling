ALTERNATIVE DIFFUSION-BASED KINETIC MODELING FOR FREE-RADICAL POLYMERIZATION REACTIONS

This work, developed by João G. Neto, Gustavo D. Azevedo and Amanda L. T. Brandão, was presented in the 15th Brazilian Polymer Conference on October 2019. 

Abstract – In pursuance of improving polymerization simulations, a diffusion-based model for free-radical polymerization was studied. The proposed model is based on the Diffusion-Control mechanism presented by Achilias and Kiparissides [1] with changes that adjusted the monomer conversion to better represent the experimental data. The main modifications include the initiator’s efficiency, the estimation of the reaction probability factor for two radicals in proximity, the assumption of the quasi-steady-state approximation and the use of alternative expressions for the polymerization kinetic constants. The major advantage of using a diffusion-controlled model is the glass and the gel effects are backed up by transport phenomena instead of critical breaking points. The simulation was implemented for the polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) with azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as the initiator in the conditions presented in literature [1] to enable a proper comparison of the results.
